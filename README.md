# Veeraj-Rangnekar-Data-Bootcamp-Final

This project was completed by Veeraj here in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Fall 2020. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In
particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text
and the bibliography.
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.
Project Description


The program makes use of the Paleobiology Database, a database tracking millions of "occurences" of fossils referenced in research papers studying paleontology.
When a fossil is found as part of a study, information is collected about the fossil and the surrounding geological conditions. This information is represented
as columns within a dataframe containing data imported from the Paleobiology Database, or PBDB. Each occurence represents a single species found at a site, and can contain multiple specimens.This particular dataset includes data on 546979 occurences located in North America. The PBDB contains data on over 1.4 million occurences in total. This may seem like a lot, but the fossils you see here are not exactly the kind of fossil you may see in a museum. We have utilized this dataset to create a geolocator of fossils within the United States based on the entry of coordinates. We have also included a search device to locate specific species of the fossils found in North America. Finally, we have provided some analysis from the dataset to more properly understand the data and better utilize the information when locating and identifying fossils. Overall, this program is intended for all individuals attempting to search for fossils around their current location and understanding the significance, age, and environment the original creature survived in.
